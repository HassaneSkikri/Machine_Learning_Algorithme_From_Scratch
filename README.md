# Machine Learning Model Implementations

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of fundamental machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch. These implementations serve as a practical reference for understanding the mechanics behind some of the most popular machine learning models.

## Models Included
- **Linear Regression**: Implementation of linear regression model for predicting continuous outcomes.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
- **Linear and Logistic Regression Combined**: A combined implementation to compare linear and logistic regression models.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: A lazy learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the k-nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Tree**: Construction of a decision tree for classification tasks.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control over-fitting.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: An SVM implementation for finding the optimal hyperplane for classification tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine, as well as the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for dataset loading and model comparison)

### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HassaneSkikri/Machine_Learning_Algorithme_From_Scratch.git
